# Paper Correction Management System

## Project Overview
The **Paper Correction Management System** is a web-based application designed to streamline the process of evaluating examination papers. The system aims to:
- Improve the efficiency of paper correction by automating workflows.
- Provide faculty members with tools to evaluate papers effectively.
- Grant Heads of Departments (HODs) control over the paper evaluation process to ensure transparency and accountability.
- Minimize the overall cost and time associated with traditional paper correction methods.

## Features
- **Faculty Dashboard**: Interface for teachers to access, evaluate, and manage assigned papers.
- **HOD Control Panel**: Monitor and manage the evaluation process, reassign papers, and generate reports.
- **Real-time Updates**: Track progress and completion status of paper corrections.
- **Audit Trails**: Maintain logs for accountability and error tracking.
- **Cost Analysis**: Insights into resources and costs associated with the correction process.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Golang
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Deployment**: To be determined (e.g., AWS, Docker)

## Installation
### Prerequisites
1. **Node.js** (for React)
2. **Golang**
3. **PostgreSQL**
4. **Git**

### Setup Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PragaL15/coe_module
   cd project-root
   ```

2. Set up the backend:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   go mod tidy
   go run main.go
   ```

3. Set up the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Configure the PostgreSQL database:

   - Update the backend configuration to connect to the database.

## Usage
- Faculty members can log in to view their assigned papers.
- HODs can manage assignments, review progress, and generate detailed reports.

## Roadmap
1. **Phase 1**: Core functionality - faculty evaluation and HOD controls.
2. **Phase 2**: Cost analysis and reporting modules.
3. **Phase 3**: Scalability and integration with external systems (if needed).
